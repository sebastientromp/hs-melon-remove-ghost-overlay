A Hearthstone mod for Firestone that removes the "ghost" overlay when examining cards you don't own in your collection, thus letting you see all the card details.

# Installation

Just drop [the latest DLL](https://github.com/sebastientromp/hs-melon-remove-ghost-overlay/releases/latest/download/RemoveGhostOverlayWhenExaminingCard.dll) into your Hearthstone Mods folder (you need to have installed MelonLoader first).

See https://github.com/Zero-to-Heroes/firestone/wiki/Mods for more Hearthstone mods, and some infos about how to install them.
